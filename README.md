# Encapsulation of JPEG2000 Images

The purpose of this repository is to provide example HEIF files that are compliant with ISO/IEC 15444-16 in storing JPEG 2000 compressed imagery.

**Plans for the Future**
* Add a J2K codec to libheif
* Have mp4box.js parse J2K in HEIF files. 
* Write sofware for comformance testing
