# Enoji Overview
ISO/IEC 15444-16 defines how to store JPEG2000 imagery into HEIF, however there are virtually zero software tools for handling such files. The purpose of this repository is to provide a handful of sample files to aid in the development of such tools.

For now, we're asking the community to help verify their compliance. Eventually, we would like to write software that automates this compliance verification process.

**Plans for the Future**
* Encapsulate HTJ2K images in HEIF.
* Add a J2K codec to libheif.
* Have mp4box.js parse J2K in HEIF files. 
* Write sofware to automate comformance testing.
