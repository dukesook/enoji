## Enoji Overview
ISO/IEC 15444-16 defines how to store JPEG2000 compressed imagery into HEIF, however there are virtually zero tools for handling such files. The libheif open-source library is able to generate J2K in HEIF files.

There are no licensing restrictions tied to any of these images.

## Plans for the Future
* Encapsulate HTJ2K images in HEIF.
* Write sofware to automate comformance testing.
